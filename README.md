# Student-Result-Analysis
## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the factors influencing students' academic performance in Math, Reading, and Writing scores. By exploring the interplay between socio-economic factors (such as parental marital status and education), personal habits (such as weekly study hours and participation in sports), and academic outcomes, the project aims to uncover actionable insights to improve educational strategies and student outcomes

## Key Insights
Key findings highlighted how parental marital status, time spent on weekly self-study, and regular participation in sports or outdoor activities significantly affect students' academic outcomes. For example, students who engage in regular study sessions and extracurricular activities tend to perform better in all three test areas. The analysis also delved into the effects of socio-economic factors like parental education and access to resources, providing a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
Through effective data cleaning, exploration, and visualization in Jupyter Notebook, this project demonstrates the interaction between personal habits and socio-economic factors in shaping academic success.
